# Readme-generator



This is a node program that allows the user to generate a Readme for their project right from their own terminal. 
it asks for general information about the project plus the users git hub information/liscencing.

when started the program will ask:
"What is your project title?"
"Type your description for your project: "
"Please provide your project's installation instructions: "
"Please provide project (any) license(s): "
 "Please provide the contributing members of the project: "
 "Please provide the project tests: "
 "What is your GitHub username? "
 "What is the link to your GitHub repository? "
 
 
 and it will compile that information into a pushable readme for the users project!
